# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study: 

##  Introduction to the Problem

As a junior data analyst we are working within the marketing analysis team at a bike-sharing company in Chicago, called Cyclistic.

**Cyclistic**: A bike-share program that features more than 5800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities
and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike.

The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. The company decided to offer flexible pricing plans, including: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.

- Casual Riders: Customers who purchase single-ride or fully-day passes.
- Annual Members: Customers who purchase annual memberships.

The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketing (Moreno) believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members.


### Goal of the Junior Data Analyst:


The primary goal is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting Casual Riders into Annual Members.

In order to achieve this, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.

### Analysis and Report of the Junior Data Analyst:

Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

You will produce a report with the following deliverables:

1. A clear statement of the business task.
2. A description of all data sources used.
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data.
4. A summary of your analysis.
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings.
6. Your recommendations based on your analysis


##  Solution to the Problem

### 1. Business Task

The company Cyclistic aims to increase the amount of its annual memberships, as Cyclistic members are more profitable compared to casual riders. Our main task is to design marketing strategies that will encourage casual riders to convert into Cyclist members. In order to achieve this, the team needs to understand from our analysis how casual riders use bicycles compared to Cyclist members or otherwise how casual riders differ from Cyclistic members.
